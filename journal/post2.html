        This learning journal involves our response and thoughts to one of two articles. I chose “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” by Naema Baskanderi. A modal window by definition of this article is an element that sits on top of an application’s main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible with the modal window as a child window in front of it. 
      </p>

      <p>
         Naema goes over the idea that most users nowadays are actually naturally adverse to modals and need to be incentivised to not try to quickly remove it or interact with it as little as possible.
      </p>

      <p> 
        When using a modal, you need to be able to understand exactly why you’re trying to use it before deciding what to do next. You could be attempting to grab the user’s attention, get their input, show additional information, etc
      </p>

      <h2>Best patterns to include</h2>

      <p>
        Things like escape hatches, proper sizing, buttons to interact with, descriptive titles, and accessibility are all key factors into creating a successful modal. If the user can’t hit escape to leave, or if the modal takes up too much space, you’ll be creating an ergative experience.
